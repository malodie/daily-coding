# Problem
```Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.

For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.

Bonus: Can you do this in one pass?
```
# Pseudocode
```
#Create a list of numbers
#Create a variable k
#Set k equal to a number
#Write add function
#Randomly get two numbers from the list and add them
#Write compare function
#Run the compare
```
